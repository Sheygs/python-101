## What I learnt
- Indentation refers to spaces at the beginning of a code
- Python uses indentation to refer to a block of code
- Lack of indentation to a code returns an error
- Single Line comment can be represented using the `#` sign
- Multi Line comment are represented by triple quotes `"""`

```
  # This is a single line comment
```

``` 
"""
   This is a multi line comment
"""
```
