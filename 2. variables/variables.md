## Summary

- Python is an object oriented programming language. It is not "statically" typed meaning you don't have to declare a variable before using them or declare their type.

- Every variable in python is an object.

- A variable is __ONLY__ created when it is assigned a value. 

### Rules for python variables.

- A variable can only start with an underscores(`_`) or a letter
- A variable cannot start with a number
- A variable can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores i.e. (`a-zA-Z_`)
- A variable is case-sensitive i.e. `age`, `aGe`, `AGE` are all different.
